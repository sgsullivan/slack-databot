# slack-databot
This is really nothing more than a slack bot I use which I find useful. If you do want to try it, you will have to fill in the
proper data in `etc/databot.json`. Then, you can build it with `make`. Once built, you will find the binary at _exe/databot.

Next to run it, just run from the root of this repository `./_exe/databot`, once you have filled in `etc/databot.json` as
mentioned above.
